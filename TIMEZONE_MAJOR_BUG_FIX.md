# 🔎 Major Timezone Bug Fixed!

## 🐛 Problem Found:

I found the critical bug! The time wasn't changing when you changed timezone because **the event cards were displaying the wrong time field**:

```javascript
// WRONG - This is what the code was doing:
formatTimeForDisplay(event.startDateTime, timezone)

// CORRECT - This is what it should be doing:
formatTimeForDisplay(event.startLocal, timezone)
```

## 💡 What Was Happening:

1. The event data has two time fields:
   - `startDateTime`: The raw UTC time (always the same regardless of timezone)
   - `startLocal`: The converted time for your current timezone

2. The components were displaying `startDateTime` (raw UTC time) instead of `startLocal`

3. So even though the timezone was changing in the browser, it was always formatting the same UTC time!

## ✅ Changes Made:

1. Fixed `SimpleEventCard.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from
   {formatTimeForDisplay(event.startDateTime, timezone)}
   
   // To
   {formatTimeForDisplay(event.startLocal || event.startDateTime, timezone)}
   ```

2. Fixed `EventCard.jsx` the same way

3. Added debug indicators showing whether startLocal is being used

## 🧪 How To Test:

1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+F5)

2. **Check the time** in your event cards - it should now say "startLocal used"

3. **Change timezone** in DevTools:
   - F12 → Ctrl+Shift+P → "sensors" → Show Sensors
   - Change to London
   - Refresh page
   - Event time should now show 1:44 PM

4. **Change timezone** to New York:
   - Should show around 8:44 AM
   - Check that "(startLocal used)" appears under the time

## 📊 Expected Results:

For your 6:14 PM (Mumbai) event:
- Mumbai: 6:14 PM
- London: 1:44 PM
- New York: 8:44 AM

If you still see "raw UTC used" under any times, it means that event object doesn't have the startLocal property correctly set.

## 🧠 Root Cause Analysis:

The root issue was that there are two different time representations:
1. Raw storage time (UTC)
2. Display time (local timezone)

The event card components were using the wrong one for display!

## 🔄 What's Next?

If this fix works, we should:
1. Remove debug text from event cards
2. Do a thorough code review of all time display components
3. Add unit tests to verify timezone display behavior
4. Document timezone handling in the codebase
