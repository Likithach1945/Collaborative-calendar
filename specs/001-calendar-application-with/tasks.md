## Dependency Graph (Story Order)
Setup → Foundational → US1 (MVP) → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5 → US6 → Polish
Parallel groups within phases marked [P] can run concurrently after preceding non-[P] tasks in same phase.

## Parallel Execution Examples
- US1: T032, T033, T034, T035, T036, T037, T038 can run in parallel once T031 complete.
- US3: T053, T054, T055, T056, T057, T058, T059, T060, T061 after T052.
- Polish: Multiple tasks (T088, T089, T090, T091, T092, T094, T096, T097) parallel after any sequential prerequisites.

## Task Counts
- Total Tasks: 98
- Setup: 14
- Foundational: 16
- US1: 9
- US2: 12
- US3: 10
- US4: 8
- US5: 9
- US6: 8
- Polish: 12

## Independent Test Criteria Recap
- US1: Verify login and day/week view ordering & timezone conversion.
- US2: Event creation yields localized invitations.
- US3: Suggestion endpoint returns ≥3 slots or proper no-slot message.
- US4: ICS import processes events & reports summary/errors.
- US5: Invitation responses update organizer summary within latency.
- US6: Proposal acceptance updates event time & supersedes others.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Deliver MVP via US1 rapidly post-foundation (auth + calendar views). 
2. Iterate on collaborative features (US2–US3) to enable scheduling efficiency.
3. Onboard via ICS import (US4) and finalize interaction tracking (US5).
4. Add proposal refinement (US6) and polish for performance & accessibility.

## Notes
- Tests included because spec defines independent test criteria; maintain test-first sequence for core endpoints.
- OpenAPI contract drives backend and frontend typing (future code generation optional).

End of tasks.
