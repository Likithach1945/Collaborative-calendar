# Feature Specification: Calendar Application Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-calendar-application-with`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Calendar application with Google login, event views (day/week), event invitations with time zone handling, meeting setup with video conferencing integration, availability checking, intelligent time suggestions, ICS import, recipient accept/decline/propose new time, show accepted/declined status"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Authenticate & View Calendar (Priority: P1)
A user logs in using their Google account and views their calendar in day or week view showing events in chronological order adjusted to their own timezone.

**Why this priority**: Without secure login and reliable views the calendar delivers no core value; this is the minimal viable experience.

**Independent Test**: Sign in with a valid Google account → See day view with events sorted by start time in local timezone; toggle to week view retains ordering.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a user with existing events across multiple days, **When** they log in successfully, **Then** the day view shows only today's events sorted chronologically in user's timezone.
2. **Given** a user viewing the day view, **When** they switch to week view, **Then** events for the current week are displayed grouped by day and ordered by start time.
3. **Given** a user with no events today, **When** they view the day view, **Then** an empty state message explains how to create or import events.
4. **Given** a user in GMT-5 and an event created in GMT+1, **When** they view the event, **Then** start/end times are converted to local GMT-5.

---

### User Story 2 - Create & Send Event Invitations (Priority: P1)
User creates a new event, adds recipients (possibly in different time zones) and sends invitations.

**Why this priority**: Enables collaboration and basic scheduling beyond personal viewing.

**Independent Test**: Create event with title, start/end, participants in different time zones → Invitations generated with correct localized times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a user on creation form, **When** they enter start/end and add recipients, **Then** the form auto-adjusts display of times per recipient timezone in preview.
2. **Given** a user submits the event, **When** the system processes invitations, **Then** each recipient receives an invite with correct local time conversion.
3. **Given** a user sends an event lacking end time, **When** validation runs, **Then** an error explains end time is required.
4. **Given** a recipient timezone not resolvable, **When** an invite is generated, **Then** the invite defaults to UTC with a warning.

---

### User Story 3 - Availability & Intelligent Suggestions (Priority: P1)
User checks recipients' availability and receives suggested meeting times considering constraints across a date range.

**Why this priority**: Improves scheduling efficiency; critical for multi-user coordination and reduces back-and-forth.

**Independent Test**: Select participants + date range → System returns at least 3 valid non-overlapping suggestion slots.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** selected recipients with existing events, **When** availability check runs, **Then** busy slots are excluded from suggestions.
2. **Given** a preference for 30-minute meetings, **When** suggestions are generated, **Then** all suggestions respect requested duration.
3. **Given** no common free slot in date range, **When** suggestion engine completes, **Then** a message proposes extending range or adjusting duration.
4. **Given** overlapping events across time zones, **When** algorithm computes slots, **Then** it normalizes all times to UTC internally and presents local start times.

---

### User Story 4 - ICS Import (Priority: P1)
User imports events from a standard `.ics` file to populate their calendar.

**Why this priority**: Rapid onboarding / migration from existing calendars.

**Independent Test**: Upload valid ICS containing 5 events → All 5 appear in day/week views with accurate times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a valid ICS file with recurring events, **When** import runs, **Then** each instance or pattern is expanded per rule set.
2. **Given** a malformed ICS file, **When** import runs, **Then** processing halts with a clear error listing problematic lines.
3. **Given** duplicate events already exist, **When** import runs, **Then** duplicates are skipped and reported in summary.

### User Story 5 - Invitation Response Tracking (Priority: P1)
Recipients accept or decline invites; organizer sees accepted/declined statuses per event.

**Why this priority**: Organizer needs visibility to finalize meeting logistics.

**Independent Test**: Send invites to 3 recipients → Two accept, one declines → Status panel reflects counts and individual states.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a recipient receives invite, **When** they click accept, **Then** event status updates to "Accepted" for that recipient.
2. **Given** a recipient declines, **When** status updates, **Then** organizer sees decline reason if provided.
3. **Given** mixed responses, **When** organizer views event detail, **Then** a summary shows accepted/declined/pending totals.
4. **Given** a recipient is pending past reminder threshold, **When** system sends reminder, **Then** action is logged.

### User Story 6 - Propose New Time (Priority: P2)
Recipient proposes an alternative meeting time which organizer can accept or reject.

**Why this priority**: Enhances flexibility for conflicts while preserving structured workflow.

**Independent Test**: A recipient proposes new time → Organizer accepts → Event updates to new slot and notifies all recipients.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a recipient viewing invite, **When** they propose a new time, **Then** proposal includes start/end and optional note.
2. **Given** an organizer reviewing proposals, **When** they accept one, **Then** event time updates and all participants receive updated notifications.
3. **Given** organizer rejects proposal, **When** action taken, **Then** recipient sees rejection reason.
4. **Given** multiple proposals, **When** organizer selects one, **Then** others are marked superseded.

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- Import ICS with events spanning DST transition.
- Invitation to recipient lacking timezone info.
- Suggestion generation with no overlapping free time windows.
- Accept/decline after event start time (late response).
- Propose new time overlapping existing accepted meeting.
- ICS recurring rule referencing unsupported frequency.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow Google OAuth 2.0 login (assumed standard flow; token refresh handled).
- **FR-002**: System MUST display events in day and week views sorted by start time in user's local timezone.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow creation of events with title, description, start/end, participants list, timezone normalization.
- **FR-004**: System MUST send invitations to all participants including localized times.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide availability checking across selected recipients for a date range.
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate at least 3 meeting time suggestions when feasible within provided constraints.
- **FR-007**: System MUST import events from a standards-compliant ICS file including recurring events.
- **FR-008**: System MUST track per-recipient response status (pending, accepted, declined, proposed-new-time).
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow recipients to propose a new meeting time once per invite unless organizer resets.
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle timezone conversions using a canonical source (e.g., IANA tz database).
- **FR-011**: System MUST surface a summary of responses for each event (counts + individual states).
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate required event fields and reject incomplete submissions with actionable errors.

*Clarified decisions (initial best guesses)*
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate with Google Meet only for MVP (simplest path; extensibility deferred).
- **FR-014**: System MUST send a single default reminder 10 minutes before event start (user-level configurability deferred).
- **FR-015**: System MUST exclude recurring meeting suggestion logic in MVP (recurrence handled only for ICS import, not suggestion engine).

### Key Entities
- **User**: Account holder authenticated via Google; attributes: id, email, displayName, timezone, preferences.
- **Event**: Calendar event; attributes: id, organizerId, title, description, startDateTime (UTC), endDateTime (UTC), timezone, recurrenceRule?, videoConferenceLink?, location?, createdAt.
- **Invitation**: Per-recipient invitation; attributes: id, eventId, recipientEmail, status(enum: pending|accepted|declined|proposed), proposedStart?, proposedEnd?, responseNote?, respondedAt.
- **AvailabilitySlot**: Free/busy representation used for suggestion generation; attributes: userId, startDateTime, endDateTime, busyFlag.
- **Suggestion**: Generated meeting slot candidate; attributes: id, eventDraftId?, startDateTime, endDateTime, score, conflicts(list of userIds?).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

#### Measurable Outcomes
- **SC-001**: 95% of logins succeed under 5 seconds.
- **SC-002**: Day/week view renders sorted events in < 1.5 seconds for 90% of cases (<= 200 events/week).
- **SC-003**: Availability suggestions return at least 3 slots in < 3 seconds for <= 10 participants 80% of time.
- **SC-004**: ICS import processes 500 events (including 50 recurring patterns) in < 8 seconds with > 99% accuracy.
- **SC-005**: Recipient response status updates propagate to organizer view within 2 seconds 95% of time.
- **SC-006**: At least 70% of proposed new time requests are resolved (accepted or rejected) within 1 business day.

### Assumptions
- Google OAuth sufficient for initial release; no non-Google identity providers in MVP.
- Video conferencing integration defaults to Google Meet if not clarified.
- Reminder default assumed 10 minutes before start if not clarified.
- Recurring meeting suggestion algorithm optional for MVP; may be deferred.
- Timezone database always available; fallback is UTC.

### Dependencies
- External: Google OAuth, Video conferencing API (to be clarified), Email or notification service for invites.
- Libraries/services for ICS parsing and timezone handling.

### Out of Scope
- Resource booking (rooms/equipment).
- Complex conflict resolution workflows beyond single new time proposal per recipient.
- Multi-tenancy / organization administration features.

## Clarification Decisions
All prior clarification markers have been resolved with pragmatic MVP defaults:
1. Video conferencing integration limited to Google Meet.
2. Single 10-minute pre-event reminder.
3. Recurring suggestion generation deferred (non-MVP).
