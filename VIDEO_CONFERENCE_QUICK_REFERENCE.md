## 🎓 How It Works

```
EVENT CREATION
├─ User creates event
├─ Backend generates Jitsi room name
├─ URL created: https://meet.jitsi.org/event-XXXX-XXX
└─ Stored in database

USER JOINS
├─ User opens event modal
├─ Sees [Join Meeting] button
├─ Clicks button
├─ Jitsi Meet opens
└─ Video conference active ✅
```

---

## 🔄 No Database Migration Needed

```sql
-- Before data still works
SELECT * FROM events WHERE video_conference_link LIKE '%meet.google.com%';

-- New data uses Jitsi
SELECT * FROM events WHERE video_conference_link LIKE '%meet.jitsi.org%';
```
