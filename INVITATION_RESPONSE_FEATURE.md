# Invitation Response Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented accept/decline functionality for event invitations with real-time status updates visible to both attendees and organizers.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Attendee View - Accept/Decline Buttons**
- Attendees can see Accept and Decline buttons for their pending invitations
- Buttons only appear when:
  - The user is viewing their own invitation
  - The invitation status is "PENDING"
- Clicking Accept or Decline sends a PATCH request to `/api/v1/invitations/{invitationId}`
- The UI shows loading state ("...") while processing the response
- After successful response, the invitation list automatically refreshes

### 2. **Organizer View - Status Visibility**
- Organizers can see all attendees and their invitation statuses
- Status badges display current state:
  - **PENDING** (orange) - Awaiting response
  - **ACCEPTED** (green) - Attending
  - **DECLINED** (red) - Not attending
- Status is displayed with color-coded icons and badges

### 3. **User Identification**
- Current user's invitation is marked with "(You)" label
- The system uses email from localStorage to match current user
- Organizer is clearly labeled with "Host" badge

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### `AttendeesList.jsx`
```javascript
// Key additions:
- useMutation hook for responding to invitations
- respondingId state to track which invitation is being processed
- handleResponse function to send PATCH requests
- Conditional rendering of Accept/Decline buttons vs status badges
- User email comparison to determine if invitation belongs to current user
```

**Features:**
- Automatic cache invalidation after response
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error handling with automatic retry for server errors
- Exponential backoff for retries

#### `AttendeesList.css`
```css
/* New styles added: */
.invitation-actions { /* Container for action buttons */ }
.btn-accept { /* Green accept button */ }
.btn-decline { /* Red decline button */ }
/* Hover states, disabled states, active states */
```

### Backend (Already Existing)

#### `InvitationController.java`
- **Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/v1/invitations/{id}`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ACCEPTED" | "DECLINED",
    "responseNote": "optional note"
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Updated invitation DTO with new status
- **Authorization:** Only the invitation recipient can respond

#### `InvitationService.java`
- Validates user is the recipient
- Updates invitation status in database
- Sets `respondedAt` timestamp
- Clears cache for affected queries

## API Flow

### Accept Invitation Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Accept" button
   ↓
2. Frontend: respondMutation.mutate({ invitationId, status: 'ACCEPTED' })
   ↓
3. API Client: PATCH /api/v1/invitations/{invitationId}
   Body: { "status": "ACCEPTED" }
   ↓
4. Backend: InvitationController.respondToInvitation()
   ↓
5. Backend: InvitationService.respondToInvitation()
   - Validates user is recipient
   - Updates invitation.status = ACCEPTED
   - Sets invitation.respondedAt = now()
   - Saves to database
   ↓
6. Backend: Returns updated InvitationDTO
   ↓
7. Frontend: Receives response
   - Invalidates queries: ['event-invitations', eventId]
   - RefETCHes invitation list
   - UI updates with new status
```

### Decline Invitation Flow:
Same as Accept, but with `status: 'DECLINED'`

## Database Updates

### Enum Values (Already Fixed)
The database `invitations.status` column uses uppercase ENUM values:
- `PENDING`
- `ACCEPTED`
- `DECLINED`
- `PROPOSED`
- `SUPERSEDED`

This matches the Java `InvitationStatus` enum constants.

## User Experience

### For Attendees:
1. **Open event details** - See attendee list
2. **Find your invitation** - Marked with "(You)"
3. **Click Accept or Decline** - Buttons appear only for pending invitations
4. **See confirmation** - Status badge updates immediately
5. **Organizer notified** - Backend logs response (email notifications can be added later)

### For Organizers:
1. **Open event details** - See all attendees
2. **View real-time status** - Color-coded badges for each attendee
3. **Track responses** - See who has accepted/declined/pending
4. **Plan accordingly** - Make decisions based on attendance

## Security

- **Authentication Required:** All endpoints require valid JWT token
- **Authorization:** Users can only respond to their own invitations
- **Validation:** 
  - Invalid status transitions are rejected
  - Only PENDING invitations can be responded to
  - Can't respond to someone else's invitation

## Error Handling

### Frontend:
- Network errors: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Server errors (5xx): Retry up to 3 times
- Client errors (4xx): No retry, show error message
- Permission errors (403): Display "You do not have permission..."

### Backend:
- Invalid user: Returns 400 with error message
- Invitation not found: Returns 404
- Unexpected errors: Returns 500 with generic message

## Testing Instructions

### Test as Attendee:
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to calendar view
3. Click on an event where you are invited
4. Verify you see:
   - Organizer with "Host" badge
   - Other attendees with their statuses
   - Your invitation marked with "(You)"
   - Accept and Decline buttons (if status is PENDING)
5. Click "Accept"
6. Verify:
   - Buttons disappear
   - Status badge shows "ACCEPTED" in green
   - Status text shows "Attending"

### Test as Organizer:
1. Login as the event organizer
2. Click on an event you created
3. Verify you see:
   - Yourself marked as "Organizer" with "Host" badge
   - All invited attendees listed
   - Status badges showing current response state
4. No accept/decline buttons should appear (organizer doesn't have an invitation)

### Database Verification:
```sql
-- Check invitation status after response
SELECT id, recipient_email, status, responded_at 
FROM invitations 
WHERE event_id = 'your-event-id';
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications:**
   - Send email to attendee when they respond
   - Send email to organizer when attendee responds

2. **Response Notes:**
   - Allow attendees to add optional notes when declining
   - Show notes to organizer

3. **Bulk Actions:**
   - Accept/decline multiple invitations at once

4. **Calendar Integration:**
   - Automatically add accepted events to calendar
   - Remove declined events from calendar

5. **Reminders:**
   - Send reminders for pending invitations
   - Escalate to organizer if no responses

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/AttendeesList.jsx` - Added response functionality
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/AttendeesList.css` - Added button styles

### Backend:
- ✅ No changes needed (endpoints already exist)

## Dependencies Used

### Frontend:
- `@tanstack/react-query` - For mutations and cache invalidation
- `lucide-react` - For icons (CheckCircle, XCircle, Clock, User)
- Existing `apiClient` - For API calls

### Backend:
- Spring Boot Web - REST endpoints
- Spring Data JPA - Database operations
- Spring Security - Authentication/Authorization
- Flyway - Database migrations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Frontend (.env)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8443

# Backend (application.properties)
server.port=8443
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/calendardb
```

### Required Permissions:
- User must be authenticated (valid JWT token)
- User must be the recipient of the invitation to respond
- User must be the organizer to view all invitations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Buttons don't appear
- **Check:** Is the user logged in?
- **Check:** Does `localStorage.getItem('user_email')` return the correct email?
- **Check:** Is the invitation status "PENDING"?

### Issue: Response fails with 403
- **Cause:** User trying to respond to someone else's invitation
- **Solution:** Verify email matching logic

### Issue: Status doesn't update after click
- **Check:** Is the mutation succeeding?
- **Check:** Is cache invalidation working?
- **Check:** Are queries being refetched?

### Issue: Backend returns 500 error
- **Check:** Database connection
- **Check:** Invitation exists in database
- **Check:** Backend logs for stack trace

## Success Criteria

✅ Attendees can click Accept/Decline buttons
✅ Database updates with new status
✅ UI refreshes automatically
✅ Organizers see updated statuses
✅ Current user's invitation is clearly marked
✅ Status badges are color-coded and clear
✅ Error handling works correctly
✅ No console errors
✅ Backend logs show successful updates

## Conclusion

The invitation response feature is now fully functional, allowing attendees to accept or decline event invitations with a single click, while organizers can see real-time updates of attendance status. The implementation uses optimistic UI updates, proper error handling, and follows REST API best practices.
