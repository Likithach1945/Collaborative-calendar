# 🔍 Timezone Debug - FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem Found

I found the issue! There was a hardcoded timezone override in `WeekView.jsx`:

```javascript
// FORCE BROWSER TIMEZONE FOR TESTING - IGNORE USER TIMEZONE
const browserTimezone = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;
const timezone = browserTimezone; // Forcing browser timezone to debug
```

This was **completely overriding** the timezone detection and DevTools timezone changes! It was forcing your local browser timezone regardless of any settings.

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. Removed the hardcoded override:
   ```javascript
   // Use browser timezone if user timezone is not set
   const timezone = user?.timezone || Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;
   ```

2. Added detailed debug logging for event positioning

## 🔄 How to Test It Now

1. Make sure you **hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5) to clear browser cache
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Sensors tab → Change location to "London"
3. Refresh the page (F5)
4. Check the console logs - they should show Europe/London as the timezone
5. Your 8:11 AM event should now show as ~3:41 AM in London time!

## 🧪 Debugging Tips

The new debug logs will show:
- The browser timezone being detected
- The user timezone from DB (null)
- The final timezone being used
- Event positioning calculations

Look for these logs in the console:
```
🌍 WeekView - Browser timezone detection: Europe/London
🌍 WeekView - User timezone from DB: null
🌍 WeekView - Final timezone being used: Europe/London
```

And event position logs:
```
🎯 Event Positioning: {
  title: "Social Event",
  timezone: "Europe/London",
  convertedStart: "Sun Oct 19 2025 03:41:00 GMT+0100...",
  hours: 3,
  minutes: 41
}
```

## 📊 Expected Results

When you change DevTools timezone:

| Location | Timezone | Event Time |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Mumbai | Asia/Kolkata | 8:11 AM |
| New York | America/New_York | 10:41 PM (prev day) |
| London | Europe/London | 3:41 AM |
| Tokyo | Asia/Tokyo | 11:41 AM |

## 🔍 What Was Happening

1. Your user had NULL timezone in DB
2. The code should fall back to browser timezone
3. But someone added a debug override that **ignored** DevTools timezone changes
4. This made it seem like timezone changes weren't working

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test changing timezone in DevTools again
2. Check the event positions in different timezones
3. Look at event creation form to verify "Your timezone: XXX" shows the correct timezone
4. Consider adding a timezone selector in user settings
