# Video Conference Meeting Error - Complete Resolution

## 🚨 Issue
When clicking "Join Meeting" in event modal, Google Meet displays error:
```
Check your meeting code
Make sure that you've entered the correct meeting code in the URL
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The application was generating **fake Google Meet codes** that don't exist in Google's infrastructure:

| Component | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Backend** | Generated arbitrary codes like `abc-defg-hij123` |
| **Code Format** | While syntactically similar to Google Meet URLs, codes weren't real |
| **Google's Response** | Rejected codes as invalid since they weren't created via API |
| **User Experience** | "Check your meeting code" error when trying to join |

**Why This Happened:**
- Google Meet codes must be generated through Google Calendar API
- The implementation tried to create codes without proper API integration
- Result: Invalid codes that Google Meet rejects

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Strategy: Switch to Jitsi Meet
Instead of using Google Meet (which requires API), use **Jitsi Meet** - an open-source video conferencing platform that:
- ✅ Works immediately without API setup
- ✅ Creates rooms dynamically on first access
- ✅ Accepts any valid room name format
- ✅ Is free and open-source
- ✅ Can be self-hosted for production

---

## 📝 Code Modifications

### Backend: VideoConferenceService.java
**Changed:** Base URL from Google Meet to Jitsi Meet

```java
// Before
private static final String MEET_BASE_URL = "https://meet.google.com/";

// After
private static final String MEET_BASE_URL = "https://meet.jitsi.org/";
```

**Changed:** Meeting code generation logic

```java
// Before: abc-defg-hij123
// After: event-a1b2c3d4-042

private String generateMeetingCode(UUID eventId) {
    String idStr = eventId.toString().replace("-", "").substring(0, 8).toLowerCase();
    String randomSuffix = String.format("%03d", random.nextInt(1000));
    return "event-" + idStr + "-" + randomSuffix;
}
```

### Frontend: EventDetailModal.jsx
**Added:** Link validation on click

```jsx
onClick={(e) => {
  if (!event.videoConferenceLink || event.videoConferenceLink.trim() === '') {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert('Video conference link is not available for this event.');
  }
}}
```

**Added:** Display meeting link for visibility

```jsx
<code style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--border)', padding: '2px 6px', borderRadius: '3px' }}>
  {event.videoConferenceLink}
</code>
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before ❌
```
User Creates Event
    ↓
Backend generates: https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij123
    ↓
User clicks "Join Meeting"
    ↓
Google Meet receives: abc-defg-hij123
    ↓
Google rejects code (not in their database)
    ↓
Error: "Check your meeting code" ❌
```

### After ✅
```
User Creates Event
    ↓
Backend generates: https://meet.jitsi.org/event-a1b2c3d4-042
    ↓
User clicks "Join Meeting"
    ↓
Jitsi receives: event-a1b2c3d4-042
    ↓
Jitsi creates room dynamically
    ↓
Video conference opens ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### Quick Test
1. Rebuild backend: `mvn clean install && mvn spring-boot:run`
2. Create new event with video conference
3. Click "Join Meeting"
4. **Expected:** Jitsi Meet loads in new tab

### Database Verification
```sql
SELECT id, video_conference_link FROM events 
WHERE created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);

-- Should show: https://meet.jitsi.org/event-XXXXXXXX-XXX
```

### Browser DevTools Check
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Network tab → Filter "events"
3. Create event
4. Check API response → videoConferenceLink field
5. Should contain: `https://meet.jitsi.org/`

# 1. Update code (already done)
# 2. Rebuild
cd backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run

# 3. Test
# - Create event
# - Click Join Meeting

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Why Jitsi Works (Without API)
```
Jitsi Meet Architecture:
├── Public instance: meet.jitsi.org
├── Room creation: On-the-fly (no database lookup)
├── Room name validation: Basic URL format check
├── Authentication: Optional (public rooms by default)
└── Result: Any valid URL creates a room immediately

Example: https://meet.jitsi.org/my-room-12345
- First user accesses URL
- Jitsi creates the room
- Room persists for duration of session
- Subsequent users access same room
```

### Why Google Meet Failed
```
Google Meet Architecture:
├── Requires: Google Calendar API authentication
├── Code generation: Only through API
├── Code validation: Against Google's database
├── Authentication: Google Account required
└── Result: Invalid codes rejected immediately

What we did wrong:
├── Generated codes without API
├── Codes don't exist in Google's database
├── Google Meet validates and rejects codes
└── Error: "Check your meeting code"
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Problem: Link is null
**Solution:**
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify event ID is generated before link creation
3. Restart backend service

### Problem: Jitsi won't load
**Solution:**
1. Try URL directly in browser: `https://meet.jitsi.org/test-123`
2. Check internet connection
3. Try incognito/private mode
4. Disable browser extensions

### Problem: Multiple events same link
**Solution:**
- This is NOT expected
- Check event IDs are unique
- Check database for duplicate events
- Verify UUID generation is working
