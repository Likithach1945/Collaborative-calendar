## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Rebuild Backend
```bash
cd backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Create a New Event
1. Open calendar frontend
2. Create a new event (e.g., "Team Standup")
3. Add event details (time, attendees, etc.)
4. Click **Create Event**

**Expected:** Event is created with a Jitsi Meet link automatically generated

### Step 3: View Event Details
1. Click on the event to open modal
2. Look for "Video Conference" section

**Expected Format:**
```
Video Conference
Join Meeting

https://meet.jitsi.org/event-a1b2c3d4-e5f6g7h8
```

**Example URLs:**
- `https://meet.jitsi.org/event-a1b2c3d4-042`
- `https://meet.jitsi.org/event-f7e6d5c4-173`

### Step 4: Test Joining Meeting
1. Click the **"Join Meeting"** button
2. A new browser tab should open to Jitsi Meet

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Tab opens to `https://meet.jitsi.org/event-a1b2c3d4-XXX`
- ✅ Jitsi Meet interface loads (might take 5-10 seconds)
- ✅ You can enter the room with your name
- ✅ Video/audio works
- ✅ **No "Check your meeting code" error**

### Step 5: Share Meeting with Attendees
1. Copy the meeting link from the event details
2. Send to attendees
3. Attendees can join directly without any setup

**Expected:** Anyone with the link can join

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend builds successfully
- [ ] No compile errors
- [ ] Application starts on port 8443
- [ ] New events generate video conference links
- [ ] Video links follow pattern: `https://meet.jitsi.org/event-{id}-{random}`
- [ ] Clicking "Join Meeting" opens Jitsi Meet
- [ ] Jitsi video conference room loads without errors
- [ ] Can join with webcam/mic
- [ ] Multiple participants can join same room
- [ ] Room persists (same link = same room)

---

## Database Check

If you want to verify links in the database:

```sql
-- Check recently created events and their video links
SELECT id, title, video_conference_link, created_at 
FROM events 
WHERE created_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Example output:
-- id                                   | title          | video_conference_link                    | created_at
-- a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6 | Team Standup   | https://meet.jitsi.org/event-a1b2c3d4-042 | 2025-10-18 10:30:45
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Meeting Link is NULL
**Problem:** Event created but no video link

**Solution:**
1. Check backend logs:
   ```
   ERROR: Exception while generating meeting link for event
   ```
2. Verify VideoConferenceService is injected
3. Check event ID is not null when saving

### Issue 2: Jitsi Meet Won't Load
**Problem:** Clicking "Join Meeting" but Jitsi page doesn't load

**Causes:**
- Internet connection issues
- Jitsi.org is down (rare)
- Browser security/pop-up blocker

**Solution:**
1. Try direct URL in browser: `https://meet.jitsi.org/test-room-1234`
2. Disable pop-up blocker
3. Try in incognito/private mode
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

### Issue 3: Link Shows But Says "Invalid"
**Problem:** Link format looks right but Jitsi rejects it

**Solution:**
1. Check the room name format in logs
2. Verify no special characters in room name
3. Restart backend and create new event

### Issue 4: Same Event Different Links Each Time
**Problem:** Refreshing event page shows different links

**Causes:**
- Code generation not consistent
- Event ID changed
- Multiple events created

**Solution:**
1. Check database - should have only 1 video link per event
2. Verify UUID is fixed for each event
3. Check for duplicate events

## Performance Notes

- ✅ Video link generation: < 1ms
- ✅ No external API calls on event creation
- ✅ Jitsi Meet loading: 2-5 seconds (first time)
- ✅ Subsequent loads: < 1 second (cached by browser)

## Future Improvements

### Short-term
- [ ] Add option to disable video conferencing
- [ ] Allow users to provide custom meeting links
- [ ] Add "Copy Meeting Link" button
- [ ] Email meeting link to attendees

### Medium-term
- [ ] Integrate Google Calendar API for real Google Meet
- [ ] Add Zoom support
- [ ] Add Microsoft Teams support
- [ ] Video conference provider selection

### Long-term
- [ ] Self-hosted Jitsi instance for production
- [ ] Recording and playback
- [ ] Meeting analytics
- [ ] Integration with calendar notifications

## Database Migration (If Needed)

If you previously had invalid Google Meet links and want to update them:

```sql
-- Update old Google Meet links to Jitsi format
UPDATE events 
SET video_conference_link = CONCAT(
    'https://meet.jitsi.org/event-',
    SUBSTRING(REPLACE(id, '-', ''), 1, 8),
    '-',
    FLOOR(RAND() * 1000)
)
WHERE video_conference_link LIKE '%meet.google.com%'
AND video_conference_link IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## Summary

**What Fixed the Issue:**
1. Switched from fake Google Meet codes to **Jitsi Meet**
2. Jitsi Meet works without API credentials
3. Generates proper room names that Jitsi accepts
4. Immediate fix for "Check your meeting code" error

**Before:**
```
User clicks "Join Meeting"
→ Opens https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij123
→ Google Meet: "Check your meeting code" ❌ ERROR
```

**After:**
```
User clicks "Join Meeting"
→ Opens https://meet.jitsi.org/event-a1b2c3d4-042
→ Jitsi Meet loads
→ Video conference starts ✅ SUCCESS
```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify** the changes work in your environment
2. **Test** with multiple participants
3. **Gather feedback** from users
4. **Plan** for Google Calendar API integration if needed for production
5. **Document** for team deployment
